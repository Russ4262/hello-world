Sample tutorial project

Sample branch edit by Russell Johnson.
I intend to contribute to the FreeCAD project.
I enjoy some programming as a hobby. I also enjoy fabricating items and building or constructing things in general.
Most of my programming experience is with PHP, HTML, JavaScript, CSS, Python, and C++.
I am only a novice at programming, not an expert. I have not mastered any programming language.
